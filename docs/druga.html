 <div><h1>Chapter 1</h1>Magneto was born Max Eisenhardt sometime in the late 1920s to a middle-class German Jewish family. Max's father, Jakob Eisenhardt, was a decorated World War I veteran. Surviving discrimination and hardship during the Nazi rise to power, the passing of the Nuremberg Laws in 1935, and Kristallnacht, Max and his family fled to Poland where they were captured during the German invasion of Poland and sent to the Warsaw Ghetto. Max and his family escaped the ghetto, only to be betrayed and captured again. His mother, father, and sister were executed and buried in a mass grave, but Max survived, possibly due to the manifestation of his mutant powers. Escaping from the mass grave, he was ultimately captured yet again and sent to Auschwitz, where he eventually became a Sonderkommando. While at Auschwitz, Eisenhardt reunited with a Romani girl named Magda, whom he had fallen in love with when he was younger, and with whom he would escape the concentration camp during the October 7, 1944 revolt.</div>
 <div><h1>Chapter 2</h1>In referencing the U.S. declaration of war on Japan and Germany after the Pearl Harbor attack of December 7, 1941, Logan mentions that Canada had already been at war with Germany for two years. Logan further explains, “Even though I was marchin’ under the Canadian flag, I wasn’t exactly a Canadian soldier. My orders, though they came through the Canadian military, originated from somewhere else. We were called The Devil’s Brigade… an’ just like in the First World War, we did the Devil’s work. Also like in WWI, Cyber was my Commanding Officer.”</div>
<div><h1>Chapter 3</h1>After Logan and Atsuko spend a blissful night together, Lieutenant Warren sneaks into the house and shoots Logan in the head. Warren then advances on Atsuko who surprisingly holds her own in a nasty fight, that is until Warren impales her with his bayonet. Just then, Logan gets up, very much not dead, and proceeds to beat Warren to a pulp, as Warren tries to explain that the two of them are exactly the same. When Logan gets in a killing shot with the honored sword of Atsuko’s father, Warren surprisingly does not die, but explains that he, like Logan, is unstoppable. But before they can finish their fight, Warren sees a B-17 bomber overhead. A bomber by the name of Enola Gay. With a bomb by the name of Little Boy, for it is August 6, 1945. As the mushroom cloud recedes, we find that Logan, with bone claws extended, is still alive.</div>
